## In this SQL, I queried a database containing State Name data and National Name data.  I began by joining the two tables to create a table, 'most_popular' that contained names from all years after 2000 with a national count of greater than or equal to 50,000.  Subsequent queries were made using the 'most_popular' table. ##

CREATE TABLE most_popular AS
SELECT StateNames.Name, StateNames.State, StateNames.Count as StateCount, NationalNames.Count as NationalCount, StateNames.Year FROM StateNames
INNER JOIN NationalNames
ON NationalNames.Id = StateNames.Id
WHERE StateNames.Year>2000 AND NationalCount >= 50000
ORDER BY NationalCount desc;

#1. Select all fields from the table, 'most_popular.'

SELECT * FROM most_popular;

#2. What were the ten most popular names nationally since 2000?

SELECT Name, NationalCount FROM most_popular
	ORDER BY NationalCount desc
		LIMIT 10;
		
#3. What name(s) from the state of California had a NationalCount of greater than or equal to 50,000 in the year 2010?

SELECT Name, State, Year FROM most_popular
	WHERE State = 'CA' AND Year = '2010';
	
#4. Sort the names for the most_popular table alphabetically.

SELECT * FROM most_popular
	ORDER BY Name asc;
	
#5.  Select all names from the most_popular table that end in the letter 'A'.  

SELECT Name FROM most_popular
	WHERE Name LIKE '%a';

#6.  How many names from the most_popular table start with the letter 'J'?

SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM most_popular
	WHERE Name LIKE 'J%';

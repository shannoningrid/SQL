# In this SQL, I queried a dataset that represents a digital media store and includes tables for 
artists, media tracks, invoices, and customers to answer the following questions.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM customers
    WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. What are the full names and customer IDs of all customers from Brazil?

SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerID
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';


#3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
Invoice ID, Date of invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM customers
    LEFT JOIN invoices
        ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
        WHERE customers.Country = 'Brazil';

#4. Which employees are Sales Agents?

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM employees
    WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';
    
#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.   

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.  The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM employees
    JOIN customers

SELECT invoices.Total, customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country, employees.FirstName as SalesFirstName, employees.LastName as SalesLastName
FROM customers
    JOIN invoices
        ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.InvoiceId
    JOIN employees
        ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate)
FROM invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

    JOIN tracks
        ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;
        
#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name
FROM invoice_items
    JOIN tracks
        ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;
        
#12. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.name as Track, artists.Name as Artist, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks
    JOIN invoice_items
        ON tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
    JOIN albums
        ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
